## Task 3: Encapsulation
Design a class to manage employee data, demonstrating encapsulation by setting and getting employee salaries securely.


## Task 4: Polymorphism
Build a set of animal classes that demonstrate polymorphism by overriding a method for making sounds.


## Task 5: To-Do Module (Mandatory)
Develop a simple To-do crud module using Laravel Framework. Use VueJs for the view rendering (Optional),
that will be a huge advantage for you as currently we are working with SPA in our company. If you do not
know VueJs, then its ok to use blade view rending for the module.
